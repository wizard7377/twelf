(* Queues *)


(* Author: Frank Pfenning *)


(* Standard functional implementation of queues *)


(*
   Since in the typical use `delete' is not of constant amortized time we
   provide a special `toList' operation which permits constant
   amortized access under programmer control.
*)

     If  q = (inp, out)  then  q == out @ rev(inp)
