\subsection{The datatype {\ml format}}
The datatype {\ml format} specifies the data structure into which abstract
syntax trees are unparsed and which ---ultimately--- is to be output by the
printing routines.
In order to simplify the formatting, we precompute the
minimum and maximum width of the printed format for_sml each node in the format
tree. These numbers are independent of the actual page width (but they take
the actual and default indentation width into account).
*)

type mode = Hori | Vert
(* are we in horizontal or vertical mode? *)

type width = int * int
(* the minimum/maximum width of boxes *)

type widthmode = mode * mode
(* remember mode in which minimum/maximum was gotten *)

type format = Str of int * string | Brk of int * int | Dbk | Ebk | Hbx of width * int * format list | Vbx of width * int * int * format list | Hvx of (width * widthmode) * int * int * int * format list | Hov of (width * widthmode) * int * int * int * format list
(* Width, blanks, indent, skip, ... *)

(*
The function {\ml Width0} extracts the minimum and maximum width
of {\ml formats}.
The argument {\ml m} is the current mode in effect, {\ml b} is the
horizontal blanks and {\ml i} is the indent currently in effect.
These are used to determine the width of breaks and default breaks.
*)

let rec Width0 = function (m, b, i, Str (n, _)) -> (n, n) | (Hori, b, i, Brk (m, _)) -> (m, m) | (Vert, b, i, Brk (_, n)) -> (n, n) | (Hori, b, i, Dbk) -> (b, b) | (Vert, b, i, Dbk) -> (i, i) | (m, b, i, Ebk) -> (0, 0) | (m, b, i, Vbx ((min, max), _, _, _)) -> (min, max) | (m, b, i, Hbx ((min, max), _, _)) -> (min, max) | (m, b, i, Hvx (((min, max), _), _, _, _, _)) -> (min, max) | (m, b, i, Hov (((min, max), _), _, _, _, _)) -> (min, max)
let rec Width fmt  = Width0 (Hori, ! Blanks, ! Indent, fmt)
let Unused = -9999
(* a bad value to mark unused arguments of Width0 *)

(*
{\bf Caution:}
The function {\ml Width} assumes horizontal mode.
This should only make a difference, if you are looking at a break.

{\bf Improvements:}
% At the moment, breaks are denoted by their indentation and
% skip values which are used for_sml vertical mode.
% We might also want to add a third integer---the horizontal tab to be used for_sml
% this break in horizontal mode.
The use of {\em negative} numbers.
However %---particular in the vertical case---
this would need an appropriate support by
the output device.


%   We also can use an auxiliary function that preprocesses format lists to deal
%   with separators. Specifically:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item if a separator occurs in the middle of the box, its content is
%       directly inserted into the box
%     \item however, if the separator is the last item in the box, it will be`
%       suppressed
%   fun preprocess(res,[Sep(_)]) = rev res
%     | preprocess(res, Sep(sl)::t) = preprocess((rev sl) @ res, t)
%     | preprocess(res,h::t) = preprocess(h::res, t)
%     | preprocess(res,nil) = rev res

\subsection{Constructing a {\ml format}-structure}

The format structure outlined above is very minimal. In practice we
want to simplify the handling of the default cases,
and we also want to have an automatic calculation of the minimum and
maximum widths for_sml the formats.

\subsubsection{Functions to determine the width of {\ml formats}}

Let us first tackle {\bf vertical boxes}.
We start out by defining an auxiliary function
{\ml vlistWidth'} of the form:
\begin{ml}
     vlistWidth'(i,format,(tmin,tmax),(cmin,cmax))
\end{ml}
where:
\begin{description}
  \item[{\ml i}] - horizontal tab to be used for_sml breaks
  \item[{\ml format}] - format-list of which to determine horizontal weight
  \item[{\ml (tmin,tmax)}] - minimum/determined so far
  \item[{\ml (cmin,cmax)}] - current minimum and maximum of ``group''
                             where group is a list of formats up to but not
                              including a break or to the end of the list
\end{description}
And this is how the function works:
\begin{itemize}
  \item at the end of the list: the widest entry is either
        the last group or the maximum up to the last group
  \item at a break we compute the widest entry from the last group and
        the last maximum.
        The new group will start out having the width of the break
  \item for_sml all other list entries, we add their width to the width
        of the current group
\end{itemize}
The function that actually determines the width of vertical boxes
then simply starts the auxiliary function
 with a total maximum width of the list so (0,0) and the width in
   the current group so (0,0).
*)

let rec vlistWidth' = function (i, [], (totmin, totmax), (tmmin, tmmax)) -> (Max (totmin, tmmin), Max (totmax, tmmax)) | (i, Dbk :: t, (totmin, totmax), (tmmin, tmmax)) -> vlistWidth' (i, t, (Max (totmin, tmmin), Max (totmax, tmmax)), Width0 (Vert, Unused, i, Dbk)) | (i, (b) :: t, (totmin, totmax), (tmmin, tmmax)) -> vlistWidth' (i, t, (Max (totmin, tmmin), Max (totmax, tmmax)), Width0 (Vert, Unused, i, b)) | (i, x :: t, (totmin, totmax), (tmmin, tmmax)) -> vlistWidth' (i, t, (totmin, totmax), sumpair ((Width0 (Vert, Unused, i, x)), (tmmin, tmmax)))
let rec vlistWidth (l, indent)  = vlistWidth' (indent, l, (0, 0), (0, 0))
(*
Now to the purely {\bf horizontal boxes}:
these are pretty easy --- we merely sum up the widths of all entries.
However, we also need to take into account the ``default width'' of
horizontal tabs at the time, which we need to an argument
to the {\ml Width0} function.
*)

let rec hlistWidth (l, blanks)  = List.foldr (fun (fmt, (x, y)) -> sumpair (Width0 (Hori, blanks, Unused, fmt), (x, y))) (0, 0) l
(*
When we have a box that can be a
{\bf horizontal-or-vertical box}, we need to take both, a horizontal
   {\ml format} and a vertical {\ml format} into account.\\
%{\bf Caution:}
Note that we cannot assume assume that the horizontal list will
always turn out to give the maximum width, nor can the vertical
   list be expected to give the minimum
 (e.g.\ if the indent
   for_sml vertical lists is bigger than the horizontal tab for_sml horizontal
   lists).
Thus we do keep track
of which mode (horizontal or vertical) corresponds to the {\it min}
entry, and we will always use the horizontal mode for_sml the {\it max}
entry (if we have enough space left in the page we will always prefer to
use horizontal mode over vertical mode).
*)

let rec hovlistWidth (l, blanks, indent)  = ( let (vmin, vmax) = vlistWidth (l, indent) and (hmin, hmax) = hlistWidth (l, blanks) in let (min, mmode) = if vmin < hmin then (vmin, Vert) else (hmin, Hori) in  ((min, hmax), (mmode, Hori)) )
(*
Lastly we have to treat {\bf horizontal-vertical boxes}, where each break can
{\em individually}
be horizontal or vertical in such a to much of the possible.
Since we do not know the margin width in effect when the box is
printed out, we can only take the values
   computed for_sml horizontal-or-vertical maximum and
minimum boundaries for_sml horizontal-vertical boxes.
In practice we would expect horizontal-vertical boxes to ``fill out'' more of
the available linewidth and thus use fewer lines than
horizontal-or-vertical boxes.
By the way: a horizontal-vertical box that contains just one break should
always behave exactly like the corresponding horizontal-or-vertical box.
*)

let hvlistWidth = hovlistWidth
(*
\subsubsection{Constructing the actual {\ml format}-structure}

The {\ml format} structure that we defined above is very basic.
Most of the time we will want to use default boxes.
   We define several functions to perform this syntactic sugaring
   for_sml us.
As we put the boxes together, we compute their maximum and minimum widths
with the functions defined above.

{\bf Improvements:}
In a later version we might also want to have default boxes with an
indentation of 0 that would be suitable for_sml indicating corresponding
breakpoints.

Two notes:
 we take the length of the string to be its print length, and
 we can ``emulate'' CAML's {\ml V1box}es by starting a vertical box with a
break.  This ensures that the first item is all the others.
*)

let Break = Dbk
let rec Break0 b i  = Brk (b, i)
let rec String s  = Str (size s, s)
let rec String0 i s  = Str (i, s)
let Space = Str (1, Sp 1)
let rec Spaces n  = Str (n, Sp (n))
let rec Newline ()  = Str (0, Nl 1)
let rec Newlines n  = Str (0, Nl (n))
let rec Vbox l  = Vbx (vlistWidth (l, (! Indent)), (! Indent), (! Skip), l)
and Vbox0 i s l  = Vbx (vlistWidth (l, i), i, s, l)
and Hbox l  = Hbx (hlistWidth (l, (! Blanks)), (! Blanks), l)
and Hbox0 b l  = Hbx (hlistWidth (l, b), b, l)
and HVbox l  = Hvx (hvlistWidth (l, (! Blanks), (! Indent)), (! Blanks), (! Indent), (! Skip), l)
and HVbox0 b i s l  = Hvx (hvlistWidth (l, b, i), b, i, s, l)
and HOVbox l  = Hov (hovlistWidth (l, (! Blanks), (! Indent)), (! Blanks), (! Indent), (! Skip), l)
and HOVbox0 b i s l  = Hov (hovlistWidth (l, b, i), b, i, s, l)
let rec Newpage ()  = Str (0, Np ())
(*
%***********************************************************************
\subsection{Printing a {\ml format}-structure}

All ``printing'' functions other than the top-level one return the
following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a number, which is the actual print width of the expression.
      This number is needed to determine the available print-width for_sml
       subsequent expressions
  \item the string itself to be printed --- this is not necessary, however:
           a real print function of type
          {\ml string -> unit} could be used instead!
\end{itemize}

For efficiency reasons all the printing functions have been made
tail-recursive. Thus they take on an additional argument {\tt res}, a list
of the strings output so far in reverse order (i.e.\ what was output last is
at the head of the list), and these functions then also return such a string
a result, rather than just a string.

First let us define some
auxiliary printing functions
which provide printing for_sml the different types of boxes.
We will provide the functions starting with the more difficult ones and
then getting to the easy ones---so relax!

{\bf Improvements:}
We could additionally return the print width of the last actual line that
was printed. This would give surrounding boxes better formatting control
since they would know more about what ``inner boxes'' exactly do.
See also several Caution remarks in this section.

\subsubsection{Printing a horizontal-vertical box}
For summing the maximum widths of the elements of a format list we employ the
auxiliary function {\ml summaxwidth}. Since the lists of which we want to
determine the maximum width do not contain breaks, all but the last
 argument to the {\ml Width0} function is actually irrelevant.
*)

let rec summaxwidth l  = (List.foldr (fun (fmt, ysum) -> ( let (_, y) = Width0 (Hori, Unused, Unused, fmt) in  y + ysum )) 0 l)
(*
Let us now define a helper function for_sml horizontal-vertical boxes:
\begin{ml}
     gh(curr_group, hvbox_list, res)
\end{ml}
where
\begin{description}
  \item[{\ml curr\_group}] - contains elements of the ``current'' group
  \item[{\ml hvbox\_list}] - is the formats list of the horizontal-vertical
                             box
\end{description}
This function determines the groups of the {\ml hvbox\_list} where each group
reaches up to (but not including) a break or else to the end of the list.
We want to get a list with elements of the form
\begin{ml}
    (width_of_group, [group elements], Break_after_End_of_Group)
\end{ml}
At the end of the list there might not be a break, so that the break at the
end of the last group becomes the pseudo-break {\ml Ebk}.

For our grouping function we distinguish the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item we are at the end of the list and there is no ``open'' group to be
    terminated.
  \item we are at the end of the list and need to terminate an open group
    with {\ml Ebk}
  \item a break has occured, in which case we need to terminate the
    group with that break
  \item otherwise the first element is collected into the currently open
    group
\end{itemize}
*)

let rec gh = function ([], [], _) -> [] | (cg, [], res) -> rev ((summaxwidth cg, cg, Ebk) :: res) | (cg, (Dbk :: t), res) -> gh ([], t, (summaxwidth cg, cg, Dbk) :: res) | (cg, ((b) :: t), res) -> gh ([], t, (summaxwidth cg, cg, b) :: res) | (cg, (h :: t), res) -> gh (cg @ [h], t, res)
(*
Finally here comes the function {\ml pphv} to print a
horizontal-vertical box. The format is:
\begin{ml}
  pphv(margin,leftindent,blanks,indent_step,skip_step,max_prlen,cur_hw,lastbreak,grlilst,res)
\end{ml}
where
\begin{description}
  \item[{\ml margin}] - is the position of rightmost column in which to print
  \item[{\ml leftindent}] - the leftmost column of the current
         horizontal-vertical box
  \item[{\ml blanks}] - the number of blanks to print for_sml a horizontal tab
  \item[{\ml indent\_step}] - the indent tab to be used for_sml vertical breaks
  \item[{\ml skip\_step}] - the vertical tab to be used for_sml breaks
  \item[{\ml max\_prlen}] - the maximum horizontal width into which we have
       printed so far
  \item[{\ml cur\_hw}] - the current printwidth of the present horizontal
       line
  \item[{\ml lastbreak}] - the break that terminated the previous group
         ({\ml Ebk)} if no previous group exists)
  \item[{\ml grlist}] - the list containing the groups which are left to print
\end{description}
And here is the algorithm:
Instead of printing a list of formats (as the other box-printing functions do)
we print a filtered list of ``groups'' each of which is terminated
by a break (possibly the pseudo-break {\ml Ebk}). This break will
not be immediately printed, but handed over to the printing of the
next group which ---upon knowing the print width of itself, and the
available space on the page--- determines
whether to interpret the a vertical or a horizontal break.
We thus get:
\begin{itemize}
   \item if we reach the end of all groups in the horizontal-vertical box,
         we are finished and return the maximum actual
         printwidth of the box.\\
         {\bf Caution:} Do we print the last break command inside the box after
          the end of the last group?
         If so, we do not know whether to print a horizontal a
         vertical break, because no text is following it.
         Thus {\em if the last break in a horizontal-vertical box is the last
         token in that box, it will not be printed at all!}\\
         {\bf Caution:} The maximum box width returned by the printing
         function clearly can be much wider
         than the length of the last line in the horizontal-vertical box.
         If the enclosing box just continues printing from there, results
         might not expected!
   \item if there is at least one more group to print:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item if this group fits within the pagewidth, i.e.\
               {\it left indentation of vertical box}$+${\it current
                 printedwidth}$+${\it potential horizontal width of last
                 breakpoint}$+${\it group printwidth}$\leq${\it pagewidth}

               (Note that if the last
               break was a pseudo-break {\ml Ebk} we should always
               pretend, that the group fits on the page, since we have
               nothing to break on. In particular this will be the case
               at the beginning of the box.)
             \begin{itemize}
                \item then interpret the last a horizontal break
                      and print it. Increase the horizontal column count
                      accordingly
                \item otherwise interpret the a vertical break
                      and print it. Adjust the horizontal column count to
                      the current left margin. Determine the new maximum
                      width of the box.
             \end{itemize}
            \item print all the elements of the group from the new
                  horizontal column
            \item now print the remaining groups in the list, passing on
               the breakpoint that terminated the group just printed
            \item the string to be printed is the ``concatenation'' from
               the individual printing routines, and its maximum width
               is returned by the last printing routine
         \end{itemize}
